-   ### ***Design***
    
- The color palette comprises 6 carefully selected hues:
  - **Blue:** `#0071a6`
  - **White:** `#dde2e8`
  - **Light Blue:** `#6ca8f0`
  - **White:** `#ffffff`
  - **Black:** `#0f0f0f`
  - **Grey:** `#dde2e8`

- The decision to incorporate **Black (#0f0f0f)** was deliberate, aiming to create a robust contrast against the dominant **Blue (#0071a6)** hero background. This choice enhances visibility and provides clarity, especially when juxtaposed with sections featuring a **White (#ffffff)** background. **Light Blue (#6ca8f0)** serves as a subtle contrast among the other three colors, strategically employed to accentuate specific elements within a section. **Grey (#dde2e8)** plays a dual role, offering a nuanced contrast between certain section backgrounds and serving as the primary color for the index page's services navigation buttons. Both **Black (#0f0f0f)** and **White (#ffffff)** function as neutral tones, maintaining compatibility with each other, and are strategically applied to reinforce the hero images. Considerations for compatibility and accessibility guided the selection of these four colors, ensuring a harmonious and user-friendly visual experience.


    -   #### Typography

        -[Roboto - Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and the default [Sans-Seriff](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/sans_serif) fonts are used across the site, with Robot being used as the default font-family for all text which exisit within my website.
