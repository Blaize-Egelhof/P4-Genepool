-   ### ***Design***
    
- The color palette comprises 6 carefully selected hues:
  - **Blue:** `#0071a6`
  - **White:** `#dde2e8`
  - **Light Blue:** `#6ca8f0`
  - **White:** `#ffffff`
  - **Black:** `#0f0f0f`
  - **Grey:** `#dde2e8`

- The decision to incorporate **Black (#0f0f0f)** was deliberate, aiming to create a robust contrast against the dominant **Blue (#0071a6)** hero background. This choice enhances visibility and provides clarity, especially when juxtaposed with sections featuring a **White (#ffffff)** background. **Light Blue (#6ca8f0)** serves as a subtle contrast among the other three colors, strategically employed to accentuate specific elements within a section. **Grey (#dde2e8)** plays a dual role, offering a nuanced contrast between certain section backgrounds and serving as the primary color for the index page's services navigation buttons. Both **Black (#0f0f0f)** and **White (#ffffff)** function as neutral tones, maintaining compatibility with each other, and are strategically applied to reinforce the hero images. Considerations for compatibility and accessibility guided the selection of these four colors, ensuring a harmonious and user-friendly visual experience.


    -   #### Typography

        -[Roboto - Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and the default [Sans-Seriff](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/sans_serif) fonts are used across the site, with Robot being used as the default font-family for all text which exisit within my website.

        - The font was chosen as it gives a very clean , crisp look to text . Ive chosen to not include any other fonts in order to maintain consistancy and visual cleanlieness for my site visitors
    
    -   #### Imagery

        - Landing Page:

          - The landing page consists of a plain lightblue background with shadows in order to create color contrast while keeping the background clean and simplistic.
          - Genepools white logo is carefully centered in the landing page , the logo's white color nicely contrasts against the vibrant blue background allowing site users to easily recognise and read the text , the image also has Genepools signiture logo designed above it , providing a better visual experience
       
		- How Can We Support You Page image:

    - Logout Page
    - Ticket View (for standard users)
    - Staff View (for admin/staff users)
    - Ticket Chat View (for both standard and staff users)

  - In order to make navigation easier and clear for users , Ive used clear bold white text over a blue background to create contrast, additionally each navigation link has a simple graphic to further clarify the function of the navigation link.

  - When a user selects a navigation link , its clearly underlined to show users which navigation link is currently selected and what page they are currently viewing.

  - The navigation bar follows the same style as the footer using both bold white text with simple graphics to clarify what the function of each footer link does, and appears in the same format on all pages - this allows for consistency throughout the site.

  - The navigation bar was created with HTML and CSS  and is fully responsive across devices.

  ### Homepage

  #### Landing Page 
  ![Landing Page](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-hero-img.PNG)

  - This homepage landing section consists of a suttle hero image (which is my company's logo) over a blue background followed by white text below immediatly stating my company's mission and function , both elements are white to immediatly grab the attention of users and provide absolute contrast compaired to the blue background. 

  - Below the white introduction text is two bootstrap buttons, these buttons are white in color with black text in order to provide contrast to the white text and logo used above the buttons, the black text provides a different form of contrast compaired to the all white and blue themes mentioned above.

  - If a user selects the "Get in Contact" button a bootstrap pop-up model appears , displaying the various methods of contacting our support channels.
   ![Pop-up Model](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/get-in-contact-btn-popup.PNG)

  #### Support Section
  ![Suppprt Section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-howcanwehelpyou-section.PNG)

  - The support section consists of a black heading over a white background to provide contrast, the "support you" wording of the heading has been bolded in order to emphasis that this section is for the needs of the client strictly, next to the text is a blue snowflake logo which is my company's logo ,I've chosen to include this in order to provide visual beauty to an otherwise generic heading. 

  - Below the black heading text is 6 gray bootstrap cards with a simple heading and a "Find Out More" Button in each , the cards have a light grey background in order to provide visual clarity to the white background , as well as to provide contrast to the black text card titles used in each. 

  - The buttons in each card have a blue border with white text , both done intentially for contrast against the grey card background , for users using a PC or laptop , when the user hovers over a specific card , the entire card gets a blue background in order to show users that they are about to select a certain card , this is also the case when a user hovers over a cards button specifically. 

  - All card buttons will direct users to the products and services page , and will specifically focus on a selected category of service on the newly rendered page.

  #### Need Help in a Hurry Section
  ![Help Section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-needhelpinahurry-section.PNG)

  - This section follows the principle of "simple is better" , this section contains our company's standard background imagery , with white text , two buttons and a simple image to the of the text and buttons. 

  - The font color of white is exclusivly used throughout this section in order to provide contrast to the mix of blue colors used in the background

  - Both buttons serve the purpose displaying information rather than functioning as an actual button , when a user hovers over the buttons the background changes to a darker shade of blue to indicate selection

  - The cartoon graphic used to the right of all elements mentioned above attempts to convey our ability to fix any computer related issue, the image primarily uses white and black colors in order to stand out over the background used.

  #### Reviews Section
  ![Review Section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-review-section.PNG)

  - The review section consists of a bootstrap carosoul , a black heading and the actual review elements. 

  - The review heading text is black and underlined in black , both to add contrast to the white background.

  - A single review is broken up into a circular container with a red border to house the reviewee's picture, the red border was chosen to provide suttle contrast, below the image container is the reviewee's review text , which is in black , below is the reviewee's name in a bolder shade of black to provide contrast compaired to their actual review . 

  - Each carosoul view consists of 3 reviews objects , with this pattern repeating on each new view, users can eiether manually toggle between the reviews or have the review page automatically change over a specific period (Default Bootrap toggle buttons used to navigate the wheel) 

  #### Request a Quote Section
  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-quote-section.PNG)

  - The request a quote section is a carefully layed out form which is intended for users to request quotes directly through my company without needing to create an account , this is intended for ease of use for new site visitors who are interested in working with us. 

  - The form carefully indicates which fields are required and which are not , the grey background ,light black text and white input box's provide clear visual clarity for users , if a user submits a quote request incorrectly they will be notified using Bootstraps messaging functionality as shown below : 
  ![Error Message](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/bootstrap-error-msg.PNG)

  - This message box is created using a red background to clearly show that something has gone wrong as the color red is never assosiated with success.
  
  - When a user succesfully creates a quote request they will be met with the following bootstrap message : 
  ![Error Message](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/bootstrap-success-msg.PNG)

  - This messsage box is created with a green background to clearly show that something has succesfully worked as green is assosiated with success 

  - Both message boxes appear in the header of all pages , and will disappear after a shortime automatically , users can also choose to close the message box manually with the black "X" on the inner-right side of the message box. 

  #### Supplier Section

  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-supplier-section.PNG)

  - This section has no heading as its inteded to provide a suttle component to wrap up the ending of the index page , this section consists of a bootstrap carosoul with images of our various suppliers. 

  - The carosoul automatically toggles views , users can only choose to navigate through the carosoul using the left and right arrow indicators

  - Ive chosen to keep the background white as all supplier logo's used , have components of different colors except for the color white , this ensures theres visual clarity for users when viewing ALL supplier logo's. 

  ### Products and Services Page

  - My products and services page consists of slightly unique header as compaired to index page in the sense that my company's logo is displayed on the left , the choice of colors, fonts and icons remain the same for consistancy. 

  - The entire page is made up of 6 Boostrap cards each with unique bold headers and text below the headers to clarify in detail what Genepool offers for each topic , both the header and text are black over a default white background in order to provide clarity for readers, the topics covered accross each cards are as follows: "Support", "Software", "Hardware", "Microsoft" , "Power Solutions" and "Networking" 

  - Below the text for each card are two bootstrap buttons , with a blue border and blue text in order to stand out from the black text used above them , for each card theres a "Get in Contact" button and a "Request a call back" button which have unique blue hover properties to highlight the type of button a user is hovering over. 

  - The "Get In contact" button when pressed triggers a bootstrap pop-up model which advertises our Product Enquires and Technical Support channels users can contact for questions of queries regarding the topics mentioned on each card. 

  - The "Request a call back" button when pressed , opens the Request a Quote Form , which is initially hidden from view. 
  
  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/products-and-services-p1.PNG)

  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/products-and-services-p4.PNG) 

  - This form follows the exact same layout and color theme as the Request a Quote form used on my index page , the decision to keep the same layout and color schema was enforced to maintain consistancy. 

  - If a user succesfully submits the form a green pop-up will appear in the header notifying users that Genepool has recived their request and will be in contact shortly. 

  ![Callback Success](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/callback-success.PNG)
