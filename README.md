-   ### ***Design***
    
- The color palette comprises 6 carefully selected hues:
  - **Blue:** `#0071a6`
  - **White:** `#dde2e8`
  - **Light Blue:** `#6ca8f0`
  - **White:** `#ffffff`
  - **Black:** `#0f0f0f`
  - **Grey:** `#dde2e8`

- We chose to use **Black (#0f0f0f)** on purpose because it really stands out against the main **Blue (#0071a6)** background. This makes everything easier to see and clearer, especially next to parts that are **White (#ffffff).** **Light Blue (#6ca8f0)** is a softer color that we use to make certain things pop out a bit without being too flashy. **Grey (#dde2e8)** is used in two ways: it's a bit different from the other background colors, making things look interesting, and it's the main color for the buttons on the homepage. Both **Black (#0f0f0f)** and **White (#ffffff)** are like middle-ground colors that work well together and help highlight the main pictures. We picked these colors very carefully to make sure everything looks good together and is easy for everyone to use and enjoy.


    -   #### Typography

        - [Roboto - Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and the default [Sans-Seriff](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/sans_serif) fonts are used across the site, with Roboto being used as the default font-family for all text which exisit within my website, Sans-Seriff is used IF for some reason Google Fonts Roboto font doesnt render correctly for site visitors.

        - The font was chosen as it gives a very clean , crisp look to text . Ive chosen to not include any other fonts in order to maintain consistancy and visual cleanlieness for my site visitors
    
#### Imagery

- **Landing Page:**
   - The background is a simple light blue with shadows to make it look interesting but still simple. The Genepool logo is in the middle of the page. Its white color stands out against the blue background, so it's easy to see and read. There's also Genepool's special logo design above it to make the page look better.

- **How Can We Support You Page Image:**
   - Just below the landing page, there's a title with a light blue snowflake logo to the right of the text. This logo adds a subtle touch to the text and is Genepool's special logo.

- **Need Help in a Hurry Image:**
   - To the right in this section, there's a cartoon drawing that looks like it's moving. It's supposed to show IT support in a fun way. The drawing doesn't have its own background, so it blends in well without making it hard for people to see and understand.

- **Review Section:**
   - Below that, there's a section with reviews about Genepool's imagery. It shows pictures of the people who gave the reviews, and these pictures were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). You can find more information in the credits section.

- **Supplier Logos Section:**
   - After the review section and below the form, there's a part showing logos from our suppliers. We got permission to use these logos in a positive way, and each logo shows the company's name so you can tell who they are.

- **Icons:**
   - All the icons used on the site are from [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

  - When a user selects a navigation link , its clearly underlined to show users which navigation link is currently selected and what page they are currently viewing.

  - The navigation bar follows the same style as the footer using both bold white text with simple graphics to clarify what the function of each footer link does, and appears in the same format on all pages - this allows for consistency throughout the site.

  ### Homepage

  #### Landing Page 
  ![Landing Page](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-hero-img.PNG)

  - This homepage landing section consists of a suttle hero image (which is my company's logo) over a blue background followed by white text below immediatly stating my company's mission and function , both elements are white to immediatly grab the attention of users and provide absolute contrast compaired to the blue background. 

  - Below the white introduction text is two bootstrap buttons, these buttons are white in color with black text in order to provide contrast to the white text and logo used above the buttons, the black text provides a different form of contrast compaired to the all white and blue themes mentioned above.

  - If a user selects the "Get in Contact" button a bootstrap pop-up model appears , displaying the various methods of contacting our support channels.
   ![Pop-up Model](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/get-in-contact-btn-popup.PNG)

  #### Support Section
  ![Suppprt Section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-howcanwehelpyou-section.PNG)

  - The support section consists of a black heading over a white background to provide contrast, the "support you" wording of the heading has been bolded in order to emphasis that this section is for the needs of the client strictly, next to the text is a blue snowflake logo which is my company's logo ,I've chosen to include this in order to provide visual beauty to an otherwise generic heading. 

  - Below the black heading text is 6 gray bootstrap cards with a simple heading and a "Find Out More" Button in each , the cards have a light grey background in order to provide visual clarity to the white background , as well as to provide contrast to the black text card titles used in each. 

  - The buttons in each card have a blue border with white text , both done intentially for contrast against the grey card background , for users using a PC or laptop , when the user hovers over a specific card , the entire card gets a blue background in order to show users that they are about to select a certain card , this is also the case when a user hovers over a cards button specifically. 

  - All card buttons will direct users to the products and services page , and will specifically focus on a selected category of service on the newly rendered page.

  #### Need Help in a Hurry Section
  ![Help Section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-needhelpinahurry-section.PNG)

  - This section follows the principle of "simple is better" , this section contains our company's standard background imagery , with white text , two buttons and a simple image to the of the text and buttons. 

  - The font color of white is exclusivly used throughout this section in order to provide contrast to the mix of blue colors used in the background

  - Both buttons serve the purpose displaying information rather than functioning as an actual button , when a user hovers over the buttons the background changes to a darker shade of blue to indicate selection

  - The cartoon graphic used to the right of all elements mentioned above attempts to convey our ability to fix any computer related issue, the image primarily uses white and black colors in order to stand out over the background used.

  #### Reviews Section
  ![Review Section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-review-section.PNG)

  - The review section consists of a bootstrap carosoul , a black heading and the actual review elements. 

  - The review heading text is black and underlined in black , both to add contrast to the white background.

  - A single review is broken up into a circular container with a red border to house the reviewee's picture, the red border was chosen to provide suttle contrast, below the image container is the reviewee's review text , which is in black , below is the reviewee's name in a bolder shade of black to provide contrast compaired to their actual review . 

  - Each carosoul view consists of 3 reviews objects , with this pattern repeating on each new view, users can eiether manually toggle between the reviews or have the review page automatically change over a specific period (Default Bootrap toggle buttons used to navigate the wheel) 

  #### Request a Quote Section
  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-quote-section.PNG)

  - The request a quote section is a carefully layed out form which is intended for users to request quotes directly through my company without needing to create an account , this is intended for ease of use for new site visitors who are interested in working with us. 

  - The form carefully indicates which fields are required and which are not , the grey background ,light black text and white input box's provide clear visual clarity for users , if a user submits a quote request incorrectly they will be notified using Bootstraps messaging functionality as shown below : 
  ![Error Message](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/bootstrap-error-msg.PNG)

  - This message box is created using a red background to clearly show that something has gone wrong as the color red is never assosiated with success.
  
  - When a user succesfully creates a quote request they will be met with the following bootstrap message : 
  ![Error Message](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/bootstrap-success-msg.PNG)

  - This messsage box is created with a green background to clearly show that something has succesfully worked as green is assosiated with success 

  - Both message boxes appear in the header of all pages , and will disappear after a shortime automatically , users can also choose to close the message box manually with the black "X" on the inner-right side of the message box. 

  #### Supplier Section

  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-supplier-section.PNG)

  - This section has no heading as its inteded to provide a suttle component to wrap up the ending of the index page , this section consists of a bootstrap carosoul with images of our various suppliers. 

  - The carosoul automatically toggles views , users can only choose to navigate through the carosoul using the left and right arrow indicators

  - Ive chosen to keep the background white as all supplier logo's used , have components of different colors except for the color white , this ensures theres visual clarity for users when viewing ALL supplier logo's. 

  ### Products and Services Page

  - My products and services page consists of slightly unique header as compaired to index page in the sense that my company's logo is displayed on the left , the choice of colors, fonts and icons remain the same for consistancy. 

  - The entire page is made up of 6 Boostrap cards each with unique bold headers and text below the headers to clarify in detail what Genepool offers for each topic , both the header and text are black over a default white background in order to provide clarity for readers, the topics covered accross each cards are as follows: "Support", "Software", "Hardware", "Microsoft" , "Power Solutions" and "Networking" 

  - Below the text for each card are two bootstrap buttons , with a blue border and blue text in order to stand out from the black text used above them , for each card theres a "Get in Contact" button and a "Request a call back" button which have unique blue hover properties to highlight the type of button a user is hovering over. 

  - The "Get In contact" button when pressed triggers a bootstrap pop-up model which advertises our Product Enquires and Technical Support channels users can contact for questions of queries regarding the topics mentioned on each card. 

  - The "Request a call back" button when pressed , opens the Request a Quote Form , which is initially hidden from view. 
  
  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/products-and-services-p1.PNG) 

  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/products-and-services-p2.PNG) 

  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/products-and-services-p3.PNG) 

  - When the blue Callback Form button is pressed a form reveals itself to users , this form is designed for users who have queries and would like to either be called back or contacted via email

  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/products-and-services-p4.PNG) 

  - This form follows the exact same layout and color theme as the Request a Quote form used on my index page , the decision to keep the same layout and color schema was enforced to maintain consistancy. 

  - If a user succesfully submits the form a green pop-up will appear in the header notifying users that Genepool has recived their request and will be in contact shortly. 

  ![Callback Success](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/callback-success.PNG) 

  - Similarly if a user doesnt complete the form correctly a red error message will display notifying users. 

  ![Callback Failure](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/callback-failure.PNG) 


  ### Clients Page
  
  - My clients page consists of unique header in the sense that my company's logo is displayed on the left , the choice of colors, fonts and icons remain the same for consistancy , users who have signed in succesfully will be greeted in the header above the left aligned Genepool logo "Hello,{*UserName*}".

  - The header remains the same as the products and services page's header in all aspects expect that the "Sign In" buttom is replaced with a "Log Out" button in order to provide a method for logged in users to log Out. 

  - Below the header is a simple underlined text declaring "My Tickets" , this section is to house all of the logged in clients ticket objects , signed in users can click the "Create Ticket Requests" button in order to reveal a Ticket Form in order to create new ticket objects. 

 ![Create a Ticket](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/create-a-ticket.PNG) 

 - Once a ticket has been created clients have the option to either edit the contents of the newly created ticket object OR view the ticket chat dialogue , the edit page for the tickets is heavily restricted for clients (Client are unable to change ticket Created date etc). 

 - If a client selects the "View" button of the respective ticket a chat dialogue of the ticket will open , this chat dialogue is intended for conversations between the Genepool Staff and the Client directly , relating to the topic mentioned in the respective ticket. 

  ![Ticket Chat](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/ticket-chat-view.PNG)

  - Clients(Ticket Owner) and staff can publish replies on the same ticket using the navigation form near the bottom of the ticket chat dialogue, depending on if the person who replied is a staff memeber or if its the origional ticket owner , their messages will look slighly different in order to easily allow users to differentiate , additionally all tickets by default have the status of "Unanswered" only when a Staff member replies to the ticket object will the status change to "Answered" anytime a client replies to their own ticket the status toggles back to "Unanswered"

  - Pagination has been used in this page , as the more objects that need to be pulled from the database , the slower the rendering of the page becomes, only 10 message objects are displayed per paginated page.(Pagination Navigation has been included)

  - Upon selecting "Edit" for a ticket clients can edit the tickets header and description. 

   ![Edit Ticket](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/edit-your-ticket.PNG)

 - Clients(Ticket Owner) and staff can update already created Ticket Objects

  ### Staff Page

  - Staff Page consists of 4 unique headings , "Unanswered Tickets" , "Answered Tickets" , "Unauthorised Quote Requests" and "Unauthorised Callback Requests" . Below each section is a grouping of all related objects. Unanswered and Answered Tickets simply pull authorised ticket objects based on their status's (Unanswered Or Answered) and groups them for visual clarity. 

  - Staff can Edit and View Ticket's created by clients , when a staff member replies to a ticket object , the status of the ticket is marked as "Answered", once this has happened both staff and clients have the option to close the ticket , if the requirements have been satisied , if a client replies to the ticket , the status is toggled back to "Unanswered" thus removing the ability to close the ticket. 

  - Closed tickets are hidden from staff and clients , but can be revealed by clicking the "Show Closed Tickets" , both clients and staff are able to re-open the tickets if needed , however only staff members have the right to delete a ticket once the status has been marked as "closed".

  -For Unauthorised Quote Requests and Unauthorised Callback Requests , staff can view the objects and make edit modifications to them , additionally they can also mark the objects as "completed" thus hiding them. 
  -These hidden objects can be revealed by clicking the "Show Completed Unauthorised Objects" link which reveals all objects , staff can choose to re-open the objects if needed , thus reversing the hidding feature.
