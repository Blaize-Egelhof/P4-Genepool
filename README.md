-   ### ***Design***
    
- The color palette comprises 6 carefully selected hues:
  - **Blue:** `#0071a6`
  - **White:** `#dde2e8`
  - **Light Blue:** `#6ca8f0`
  - **White:** `#ffffff`
  - **Black:** `#0f0f0f`
  - **Grey:** `#dde2e8`

- The choices of colors were intentionally selected,  **Black (#0f0f0f)** due to its striking contrast against the dominant **Blue (#0071a6)** backdrop. This enhances clarity and visibility, particularly alongside elements that are **White (#ffffff).** To subtly draw attention to specific details without appearing too intense, **Light Blue (#6ca8f0).** to utilize the soft hue of  **Grey (#dde2e8)** which is utilized in two ways: as an alternative to other background colors , and as the principal color for homepage buttons. Both **Black (#0f0f0f)** and **White (#ffffff)** provide strong contrast, meshing perfectly to define images. The use of the colors were used to ensure an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly experience.

    -   #### Typography

        - [Roboto - Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and the default [Sans-Seriff](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/sans_serif) fonts are used across the site, with Roboto being used as the default font-family for all text which exisit within my website, Sans-Seriff is used IF for some reason Google Fonts Roboto font doesnt render correctly for site visitors.

        - The font was chosen as it gives a very clean , crisp look to text . Ive chosen to not include any other fonts in order to maintain consistancy and visual cleanlieness for my site visitors
    
#### Imagery

- **Landing Page:**
   - The background is a simple light blue with shadows which creates a balanced contrast. The Genepool logo is in the middle of the page. Its white colour stands out against the blue background, to make the text easy to read. 

- **How Can We Support You Page Image:**
   - Just below the landing page, there's a title with a light blue snowflake logo to the right of the text. This logo adds a subtle touch to the text and is Genepool's special logo.

- **Need Help in a Hurry Image:**
   - To the right in this section, there's a cartoon dipiction of a stick man trying to immetate the idea of Computer Repair, The drawing doesn't have its own background, helping it blend into its background , creating a cleaner looking image.

- **Review Section:**
   - Below that, there's a section with reviews about Genepool's imagery built into a carousel. It shows pictures and comments of reviewer,these pictures were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). You can find more information in the credits section.

  - In order to make navigation easier and clear for users , Ive used clear bold white text over a blue background to create contrast, additionally each navigation link has a simple graphic to further clarify the function of the navigation link.

  - When a user selects a navigation link , its clearly underlined to show users which navigation link is currently selected and what page they are currently viewing.

  - The navigation bar follows the same style as the footer using both bold white text with simple graphics to clarify what the function of each footer link does, and appears in the same format on all pages - this allows for consistency throughout the site.

  - The navigation bar was created with HTML and CSS  and is fully responsive across devices.

  ### Homepage

  #### Landing Page 
  ![Landing Page](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-hero-img.PNG)

  - This homepage landing section consists of a suttle hero image (which is my company's logo) over a blue background followed by white text below immediatly stating my company's mission and function , both elements are white to immediatly grab the attention of users and provide absolute contrast compaired to the blue background. 

  - Below the white introduction text is two bootstrap buttons, these buttons are white in color with black text in order to provide contrast to the white text and logo used above the buttons, the black text provides a different form of contrast compaired to the all white and blue themes mentioned above.

  - If a user selects the "Get in Contact" button a bootstrap pop-up model appears , displaying the various methods of contacting our support channels.
   ![Pop-up Model](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/get-in-contact-btn-popup.PNG)


  - If a user selects the "Request a Quote" button , users will be immediatly directed to the Request a Quote form, this form is shown under the "Request a Quote Section"

  #### Support Section
  ![Suppprt Section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-howcanwehelpyou-section.PNG)

  - The support section consists of a black heading over a white background to provide contrast, the "support you" wording of the heading has been bolded in order to emphasis that this section is for the needs of the client strictly, next to the text is a blue snowflake logo which is my company's logo ,I've chosen to include this in order to provide visual beauty to an otherwise generic heading. 

  - Below the black heading text is 6 gray bootstrap cards with a simple heading and a "Find Out More" Button in each , the cards have a light grey background in order to provide visual clarity to the white background , as well as to provide contrast to the black text card titles used in each. 

  - The buttons in each card have a blue border with white text , both done intentially for contrast against the grey card background , for users using a PC or laptop , when the user hovers over a specific card , the entire card gets a blue background in order to show users that they are about to select a certain card , this is also the case when a user hovers over a cards button specifically. 

  - All card buttons will direct users to the products and services page , and will specifically focus on a selected category of service on the newly rendered page.

  #### Need Help in a Hurry Section
  ![Help Section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-needhelpinahurry-section.PNG)

  - This section follows the principle of "simple is better", this section contains our company's standard background imagery, with white text, two buttons and a simple image of the text and buttons. 

  - The font colour white is exclusively used throughout this section to provide contrast to the mix of blue colours used in the background

  - Both buttons serve the purpose of displaying information rather than functioning as an actual button, when a user hovers over the buttons the background changes to a darker shade of blue to indicate the selection

  - The cartoon graphic used to the right of all elements mentioned above attempts to convey our ability to fix any computer-related issue, the image primarily uses white and black colours to stand out over the background used.

  #### Reviews Section
  ![Review Section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-review-section.PNG)

  - The review section consists of a bootstrap carousel, a black heading and the actual review elements. 

  - The review heading text is black and underlined in black, both to add contrast to the white background.

  - A single review is broken up into a circular container with a red border to house the reviewee's picture, the red border was chosen to provide subtle contrast, below the image container is the reviewee's review text, which is in black, below is the reviewee's name in a bolder shade of black to provide contrast compared to their actual review. 

  - Each carousel view consists of 3 review objects, with this pattern repeating on each new view, users can either manually toggle between the reviews or have the review page automatically change over a specific period (Default Bootstrap toggle buttons used to navigate the wheel) 

  #### Request a Quote Section
  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-quote-section.PNG)

  - The request a quote section is a carefully laid out form which is intended for users to request quotes directly through my company without needing to create an account , this is intended for ease of use for new site visitors who are interested in working with us. 

  - The form carefully indicates which fields are required and which are not the grey background, light black text and white input boxes provide clear visual clarity for users, if a user submits a quote request incorrectly they will be notified using Bootstraps messaging functionality as shown below : 
  ![Error Message](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/bootstrap-error-msg.PNG)

  - This message box is created using a red background to clearly show that something has gone wrong as the colour red is never associated with success.
  
  - When a user successfully creates a quote request they will be met with the following bootstrap message : 
  ![Error Message](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/bootstrap-success-msg.PNG)

  - This message box is created with a green background to clearly show that something has successfully worked as green is associated with success 

  - Both message boxes appear in the header of all pages and will disappear after a short automatically, users can also choose to close the message box manually with the black "X" on the inner-right side of the message box. 

  #### Supplier Section

  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/landing-page-supplier-section.PNG)

  - This section has no heading as it is intended to provide a subtle component to wrap up the ending of the index page, this section consists of a bootstrap carousel with images of our various suppliers. 

  - The carousel automatically toggles views, users can only choose to navigate through the carousel using the left and right arrow indicators

  - I've chosen to keep the background white as all supplier logos used, have components of different colours except for the colour white, this ensures there's visual clarity for users when viewing ALL supplier logos. 

  ### Products and Services Page

  - My products and services page consists of a unique header as compared to my index page in the sense that my company's logo is displayed on the left, and the choice of colours, fonts and icons remain the same for consistency. 

  - The entire page is made up of 6 Boostrap cards each with unique bold headers and text below the headers to clarify in detail what Genepool offers for each topic, both the header and text are black over a default white background to provide clarity for readers, the topics covered across each card are as follows: "Support", "Software", "Hardware", "Microsoft", "Power Solutions" and "Networking" 

  - Below the text for each card are two bootstrap buttons, with a blue border and blue text to stand out from the black text used above them, for each card there's a "Get in Contact" button and a "Request a call back" button which has unique blue hover properties to highlight the type of button a user is hovering over. 

  - The "Get In contact" button when pressed triggers a bootstrap pop-up model which advertises our Product Enquires and Technical Support channels users can contact for questions or queries regarding the topics mentioned on each card. 

  - The "Request a call back" button when pressed, opens the Request a Quote Form, which is initially hidden from view. 
  
  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/products-and-services-p1.PNG) 

  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/products-and-services-p2.PNG) 

  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/products-and-services-p3.PNG) 

  - When the blue Callback Form button is pressed users are navigated to the hidden quote form,  this form is designed for users who have queries and would like to either be called back or contacted via email

  ![Request a quote section](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/products-and-services-p4.PNG) 

  - This form follows the same layout and colour theme as the Request a Quote form used on my index page, the decision to keep the same layout and colour schema was enforced to maintain consistency. 

  - If a user successfully submits the form a green pop-up will appear in the header notifying users that Genepool has received their request and will be in contact shortly. 

  ![Callback Success](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/callback-success.PNG) 

  - Similarly, if a user doesn't complete the form correctly a red error message will display notifying users. 

  ![Callback Failure](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/callback-failure.PNG) 


  ### Clients Page
  
  - My client's page consists of a unique header in the sense that my company's logo is displayed on the left, the choice of colours, fonts and icons remain the same for consistency, and users who have signed in successfully will be greeted in the header above the left aligned Genepool logo "Hello,{*UserName*}".

  - The header remains the same as the products and services page's header in all aspects except that the "Sign In" button is replaced with a "Log Out" button to provide a method for logged-in users to log Out. 

  - Below the header is a simple underlined text declaring "My Tickets" , this section is to house all of the logged-in client's ticket objects, signed users can click the "Create Ticket Requests" button to reveal a Ticket Form to create a new ticket objects. 

 ![Create a Ticket](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/create-a-ticket.PNG) 

 - Once a ticket has been created clients have the option to either edit the contents of the newly created ticket object OR view the ticket chat dialogue, the edit page for the tickets is heavily restricted for clients (Clients are unable to change ticket Created date etc). 

 - If a client selects the "View" button of the respective ticket a chat dialogue of the ticket will open, this chat dialogue is intended for conversations between the Genepool Staff and the Client directly, relating to the topic mentioned in the respective ticket. 

  ![Ticket Chat](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/ticket-chat-view.PNG)

  - Clients(Ticket Owner) and staff can publish replies on the same ticket using the navigation form near the bottom of the ticket chat dialogue, depending on if the person who replied is a staff member or if it's the original ticket owner, their messages will look slightly different to easily allow users to differentiate, additionally, all tickets by default have the status of "Unanswered" only when a Staff member replies to the ticket object will the status change to "Answered" anytime a client replies to their ticket the status toggles back to "Unanswered"

  - Pagination has been used on this page, as the more objects that need to be pulled from the database, the slower the rendering of the page becomes, only 10 message objects are displayed per paginated page. (Pagination Navigation has been included)

  - Upon selecting "Edit" for a ticket clients can edit the tickets header and description. 

   ![Edit Ticket](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/edit-your-ticket.PNG)

 - Clients(Ticket Owner) and staff can update already created Ticket Objects

  ### Staff Page

  The staff Page consists of 4 unique headings, "Unanswered Tickets", "Answered Tickets", "Unauthorised Quote Requests" and "Unauthorised Callback Requests". Below each section is a grouping of all related objects. Unanswered and Answered Tickets simply pull authorised ticket objects based on their statuses (Unanswered Or Answered) and groups them for visual clarity. 

   ![Staff Page p1](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/staff-pagep1.PNG)
   ![Staff Page p2](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/staff-pagep2.PNG)
   ![Staff Page p3](https://github.com/Blaize-Egelhof/P4-Genepool/blob/main/media/media-for-readme/staff-pagep3.PNG)

  - Staff can Edit and View Ticket created by clients, when a staff member replies to a ticket object, the status of the ticket is marked as "Answered", once this has happened both staff and clients have the option to close the ticket if the requirements have been satisfied if a client replies to the ticket, the status is toggled back to "Unanswered" thus removing the ability to close the ticket.

### ***Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO Testing***

#### Desktop Testing with [Chrome DevTools Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

#### Mobile Testing with [Chrome DevTools Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

  ### ***Further Testing***

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge browsers.

-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

-   Testing was conducted to ensure all forms POST'd correctly and the related database objects are saved correctly. 


### ***Fixed Bugs***

## Navigation Issue with "Request a Callback" Button ##

Description: When users selected the "request a callback" button on the products-and-services.html page, they were navigated to the top of the page instead of the form below. This issue was due to a JavaScript function not directing the user's view to the newly revealed form.
Fix: The issue was fixed by introducing a delay in the JavaScript function with a timer. Since the form is revealed only after the user clicks the callback button, the original JavaScript function is executed too quickly, not allowing the form reveal animation to finish. Adding the timeout function allowed the animation to complete before the JavaScript function navigated users to the form, thus achieving a smooth transition to the form post-animation.

## Cloudinary CSS Files Not Rendering ##

Description: Cloudinary CSS files were not rendering due to an incorrect STATICFILES_STORAGE setting. This issue was partly due to the nuances of hosting the application on Heroku.
Fix: The issue was resolved by setting STATICFILES_STORAGE to "cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage" and, on Heroku, using the direct URL link to the Cloudinary CSS path. This adjustment ensured that both local and Heroku-hosted versions of the application could render Cloudinary-hosted CSS files correctly.

## Extended Loading Times for Chat Messages ##

Description: There were extremely long waiting times for chat messages to render for ticket messages, primarily due to ElephantSQL's limited bandwidth and the large volume of objects being pulled from the database.
Fix: This was fixed by introducing pagination for the ticket-view.html, which only loads the first 10 messages from the database at a time. This significantly reduced loading times and introduced advanced navigation between paginated groups of messages.
Elevating Users to Staff Status
Description: There were issues elevating certain users to staff status, as there needed to be a clear division between regular clients and staff members.
Fix: The workaround involved creating a custom group in Django's admin panel and allocating users to this group. This distinction was then utilized in the views logic to determine if a user belongs to the staff group and render a different view accordingly. This approach achieved the desired separation while maintaining defensive security.

## Rendering Model Forms Efficiently ##

Description: There were difficulties in efficiently and reliably rendering model forms to perform actions like modifying and deleting specific objects.
Fix: This issue was resolved by using Django's built-in forms.as_p() method, which dynamically renders form fields based on a created form model. This solution saved considerable time and ensured consistency across the application.
